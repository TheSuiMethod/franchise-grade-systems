    <article>
        <p>I'm going to give you the honest answer that franchise brokers won't, because I have no financial incentive to make you buy one. I invested six figures in a franchise, operated it for two years, and lost everything. The business closed. I know what it looks like from the inside when the "proven system" doesn't deliver.</p>

        <p>But I'm not here to scare you away from franchising. Some franchises are genuinely excellent investments. The problem is that the franchise industry makes it very difficult to tell the good investments from the bad ones — by design. Here's how to think about it clearly.</p>

        <h2>The honest economics of franchise ownership</h2>

        <p>According to the Franchise Business Review's annual survey, roughly 51% of franchise owners report earning less than $100,000 per year. That's gross owner compensation, before personal taxes and any debt service on the investment. When you've invested $150,000-$300,000 to buy and launch a franchise, a $70,000 annual income represents a very long payback period — and a return on investment that may be worse than simply investing that money elsewhere.</p>

        <p>The top performers in franchise systems do very well. Some franchise owners earn $200,000+ annually. But the distribution is heavily skewed. The median matters more than the average, and the median franchise owner is not getting rich.</p>

        <div class="callout warning">
            <p><strong>A question most buyers don't ask:</strong> If you invest $200,000 in a franchise and earn $80,000/year, your return on investment is approximately 40% — which sounds great. But that $80,000 includes your full-time labor. If you could earn $80,000 in a job without risking $200,000 of your savings, the franchise investment is actually producing a 0% incremental return on your capital. Factor in the risk of total loss, and the math gets worse.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>When franchising makes sense</h2>

        <p>Franchising is genuinely a good path for some people in some situations. Here's when it tends to work:</p>

        <p><strong>You're buying an established brand with strong unit economics.</strong> A franchise system with 10+ years of history, hundreds of profitable locations, transparent Item 19 data showing net income (not just revenue), and low franchisee turnover is a fundamentally different investment than a newer system with 20 locations and no financial performance data. The brand recognition, operational systems, and supply chain advantages of a mature system are real and valuable.</p>

        <p><strong>You want structure, not invention.</strong> If you're transitioning from corporate employment and you genuinely want a business that comes with operating procedures, training, marketing systems, and vendor relationships already in place, a well-run franchise provides that. You're paying for a playbook. The value of that playbook depends entirely on whether it actually works — which is what due diligence determines.</p>

        <p><strong>You have adequate capital and a long time horizon.</strong> Franchise ownership works best when you have enough capital to cover the total investment plus 12-18 months of operating expenses, you don't need to draw a salary from the business for the first year, and you're planning to own for 7-10+ years, allowing the business to mature and compound.</p>

        <h2>When franchising doesn't make sense</h2>

        <p><strong>You're buying a system that's still figuring itself out.</strong> Newer franchise systems — especially those with fewer than 50 locations — may still be refining their model. You're not buying a proven system; you're paying to be a test case. Management may be learning alongside you, operational processes may change frequently, and the brand may not yet have the recognition needed to drive customer traffic to your location.</p>

        <p><strong>You're undercapitalized.</strong> If you're stretching your finances to meet the minimum investment, you're setting yourself up for a cash flow crisis. Franchises almost always cost more and take longer to become profitable than the FDD suggests. Running out of working capital during the ramp-up period is one of the most common reasons franchisees fail — and it's entirely preventable with realistic financial planning.</p>

        <p><strong>You haven't done real due diligence.</strong> Reading the FDD, calling existing franchisees, building a realistic financial model, and stress-testing the business assumptions should take weeks, not days. If you're making a decision based on a Discovery Day visit, a franchise broker's recommendation, and a feeling of excitement, you're not investing — you're gambling.</p>

        <h2>The franchise sales process is designed to create urgency</h2>

        <p>Here's something important to understand: franchise brokers earn $15,000-$25,000+ commissions when you sign. The franchise sales team has revenue targets. Discovery Day events are designed to create emotional connection to the brand. And "territory availability" pressure ("someone else is looking at your market") is a standard closing technique.</p>

        <p>None of this means every franchisor is dishonest. Many are legitimate businesses with genuine value to offer. But the sales environment is structured to move you toward signing, not to help you evaluate objectively. Your job is to separate the business decision from the sales experience.</p>

        <p>The FDD exists specifically for this purpose. It's the one place where required, factual disclosures exist outside the sales process. Reading it carefully — not just scanning it — is the single most important thing you can do before investing.</p>

        <h2>The alternative most buyers don't consider</h2>

        <p>Here's the question that changed my perspective after my franchise failed: <strong>Could I have built the same type of business independently for less money and more control?</strong></p>

        <p>For many franchise concepts — especially in services, wellness, fitness, and food — the answer is yes. The core operating systems that franchises sell (booking systems, POS, marketing processes, SOPs, vendor relationships) are all available independently. You don't need to pay a franchise fee and ongoing royalties to implement them.</p>

        <p>What you lose by going independent is brand recognition, the training program, and the support system. What you gain is control over your pricing, vendors, territory, operations, and 100% of your profits. For someone with industry experience or strong operational skills, the independent path often produces better economics over a 10-year period.</p>

        <p>This isn't the right choice for everyone. If you value the structure and brand recognition of a franchise and you're buying a system with genuinely strong unit economics, the franchise model works. But if you're buying a franchise primarily because you're afraid to start something from scratch, it's worth doing the math on both paths.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>How to decide</h2>

        <p>If you're actively evaluating a franchise, here's the process I wish I'd followed:</p>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Read the FDD with skepticism, not excitement.</strong> Focus on Item 6 (all fees and their escalation potential), Item 7 (realistic startup costs), Item 12 (territory protections and exceptions), Item 17 (exit conditions), Item 19 (financial performance — or its absence), and Item 20 (system health and turnover). Our <a href="/blog/how-to-read-franchise-fdd">guide to reading an FDD</a> covers this in detail.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Call franchisees.</strong> At least 10, chosen randomly from the Item 20 list — not from the franchisor's reference list. Ask about actual profitability (not revenue), the quality of franchisor support, unexpected costs, and whether they'd do it again.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Build a realistic financial model.</strong> Use actual fee structures, conservative revenue assumptions, and 12-18 months of working capital. If the business doesn't work with conservative assumptions, it probably won't work with optimistic ones either.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Consider the alternative.</strong> Run the same numbers for starting an independent business in the same industry. Compare the 10-year total cost (including all franchise fees) against the independent path. The difference may surprise you.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Sleep on it.</strong> If the franchisor is pressuring you to decide quickly, that pressure is a feature of their sales process — not a sign that the opportunity is special. Good franchise investments will still be available next month.</p>

        <h2>The bottom line</h2>

        <p>Is buying a franchise worth it? It depends entirely on which franchise, your financial situation, and how thoroughly you've done your homework. The franchise model is neither inherently good nor inherently bad — it's a business structure that works extremely well in some cases and fails badly in others.</p>

        <p>What I know from experience is that the worst franchise investments are made quickly, emotionally, and without serious analysis of the FDD. And the best franchise investments are made slowly, rationally, and with a clear-eyed understanding of both the costs and the alternatives.</p>

        <p>Don't let anyone — including me — tell you what to do with your money. But do the work to make an informed decision. The cost of due diligence is a few hundred dollars and a few weeks of effort. The cost of a bad franchise investment is six figures and years of your life.</p>
