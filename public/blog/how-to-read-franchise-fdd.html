    <article>
        <p>A Franchise Disclosure Document is a legal document that every franchisor must provide to prospective franchisees at least 14 days before any agreement is signed or money changes hands. It contains 23 items covering everything from the franchisor's history and fees to territory rights and financial performance data.</p>

        <p>Most people receive their FDD, feel overwhelmed by the 200+ pages, and either skip to Item 19 (the financial data) or hand the whole thing to an attorney and hope for the best. Both approaches leave serious gaps. Attorneys check legal compliance. They're not evaluating whether the <strong>business model actually works.</strong></p>

        <p>This guide walks through every item and tells you what to actually look for — not from a legal perspective, but from an operational one. It's written by someone who signed a franchise agreement, invested six figures, and watched the business fail because of issues that were right there in the FDD if I'd known how to read them.</p>

        <h2>Before you start: what the FDD is and isn't</h2>

        <p>The FDD is a <strong>disclosure</strong> document. The franchisor is required to disclose specific categories of information. They are <em>not</em> required to make it easy to understand, put it in context, or volunteer information they aren't legally obligated to share.</p>

        <p>This means the most important information in any FDD is often what's <em>not</em> there. A franchisor that chooses not to include financial performance data in Item 19 is legally compliant — and that absence should tell you something.</p>

        <div class="callout">
            <p><strong>Key principle:</strong> Read the FDD as a skeptic, not as a buyer. The franchise sales process is designed to build excitement. The FDD is the one place where cold, required facts exist. Use it accordingly.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The items that matter most (and why)</h2>

        <p>All 23 items contain useful information, but some are far more consequential than others. Here's where to focus your attention:</p>

        <h3>Item 5 and Item 6: What you'll actually pay</h3>

        <p>Item 5 covers the initial franchise fee. Item 6 covers everything else: royalties, marketing fees, technology fees, training fees, transfer fees, and any other recurring costs. Together, these items define your total cost of being in this franchise system — not just the entry price.</p>

        <p>The critical thing to look for in Item 6 isn't just the amount of each fee — it's whether the fees have caps, whether the franchisor can change them unilaterally, and whether the language contains phrases like "may modify" or "at franchisor's sole discretion." Uncapped fees that can be increased with minimal notice are one of the most common and most dangerous red flags in franchise agreements.</p>

        <div class="callout warning">
            <p><strong>Real example:</strong> A technology fee of $200/month sounds manageable. But if the FDD allows the franchisor to modify that fee with 30 days notice and no cap, that $200 could become $400 or $600. Over a 10-year term, you can't budget for a cost you can't predict.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Item 7: The real startup cost</h3>

        <p>Item 7 estimates the initial investment required to open and operate the franchise. It includes a range (low to high) for categories like buildout, equipment, initial inventory, and working capital.</p>

        <p>Two things to watch for: First, the actual cost almost always exceeds the high end of the estimate. Franchisees routinely report spending 15-30% more than the FDD's high-end figure once you account for local permitting, buildout complications, and the reality of ramp-up. Second, check the working capital estimate. If it covers only 3 months and the FDD's own data suggests it takes 12-18 months to reach breakeven, you'll need substantially more cash than Item 7 implies.</p>

        <h3>Item 12: Your territory (or lack thereof)</h3>

        <p>Item 12 describes whether you get an exclusive territory and what "exclusive" actually means. This is where careful reading pays off. A territory described as "protected" may include exceptions for online sales, third-party delivery platforms, or "alternative distribution channels" — all of which allow the franchisor to compete with you inside your own territory.</p>

        <p>Also check whether the territory can be reduced at renewal, and whether the franchisor can place another location near yours. The word "exclusive" in franchise law often means less than you'd assume.</p>

        <h3>Item 19: Financial performance representations</h3>

        <p>This is the item everyone turns to first, and for good reason — it's where the franchisor <em>may</em> disclose what existing locations earn. The key word is "may." Franchisors are not required to include this data, and many don't.</p>

        <p>If Item 19 data is present, look at these specifics: Does it show revenue only, or does it include expenses and profit? What percentage of locations are included? Are the numbers from mature locations only, or do they include newer ones? Is there a geographic breakdown? A system with 200 locations in warm climates may show very different numbers than what you'd experience in a northern market.</p>

        </div>

        <h3>Item 17: The exit clause</h3>

        <p>Item 17 covers renewal, termination, and transfer. This is the item that defines what happens when things go wrong — or even when things go right and you want to sell.</p>

        <p>Pay attention to termination triggers (what allows the franchisor to end your agreement), renewal conditions (are they automatic or at the franchisor's discretion?), and transfer restrictions (how much does it cost to sell, and can the franchisor block a sale?). Also read the post-termination non-compete. If the franchise fails and the franchisor terminates your agreement, can you open a competing business? For how long? In what geography?</p>

        <h3>Item 20: The health of the system</h3>

        <p>Item 20 shows the number of franchised and company-owned outlets, including openings, closures, terminations, and transfers over the past three years. This is raw data about system health.</p>

        <p>Calculate the turnover rate: add up closures, terminations, and transfers, then divide by total units. A system with 100 locations and 25 departures over 3 years has a 25% turnover rate — that's a red flag. Also look at the ratio of company-owned to franchised locations. If the franchisor is closing its own locations while selling franchises, ask why.</p>

        <h2>Items most people skip (but shouldn't)</h2>

        <h3>Item 2: Who's running the show</h3>

        <p>This item describes the franchisor's management team. If the leadership has turned over significantly in the last 2-3 years, or if key executives lack relevant industry experience, the "proven system" you're buying may be a work in progress.</p>

        <h3>Item 3: Litigation history</h3>

        <p>Any pending or past lawsuits involving the franchisor. One lawsuit is normal. Multiple franchisee lawsuits alleging similar issues (fraud, misrepresentation, failure to provide support) indicate a pattern. Read every case summary.</p>

        <h3>Item 8: Required vendors</h3>

        <p>This reveals whether you're required to purchase products or services from specific vendors — and whether the franchisor or its affiliates profit from those requirements. Mandatory vendors at above-market rates with no alternatives is one of the most common ways franchisees get squeezed.</p>

        <h2>What to do after reading your FDD</h2>

        <p>Reading the FDD is step one. The real work is using what you find to make a decision and negotiate better terms.</p>

        <p>First, <strong>talk to existing franchisees.</strong> Item 20 includes contact information. Call at least 10 — not the ones the franchisor recommends, but ones you choose randomly from the list. Ask them: Are you profitable? Would you do it again? What surprised you? What does the franchisor do well, and what do they do poorly?</p>

        <p>Second, <strong>build a realistic financial model.</strong> Don't use the franchisor's projections. Use the fee structure from Items 5 and 6, the investment range from Item 7, any revenue data from Item 19, and the real expenses from your franchisee conversations to build a bottom-up P&L for your specific market.</p>

        <p>Third, <strong>negotiate.</strong> Most people assume franchise agreements are non-negotiable. They're not. You may not get everything you ask for, but requesting fee caps, extended territory protections, or better renewal terms is standard practice — and any franchisor that refuses to discuss terms is telling you something about the relationship you're entering.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>The bottom line</h2>

        <p>The FDD exists to inform your decision, not to sell you on the franchise. Read it with that mindset. Focus on fees and their escalation potential, financial performance data and its limitations, territory protections and their exceptions, system health from the turnover data, and exit conditions if things don't work out.</p>

        <p>If reading 200+ pages of legal disclosures sounds overwhelming, that's understandable. But the alternative — investing $100K or more based on a sales pitch and a gut feeling — is how people lose everything. And I say that from experience.</p>
