        <h2>Services</h2>
        <p>Franchise-Grade Systems provides AI-powered franchise due diligence tools and educational resources. Our products include the AI FDD Analyzer, financial calculators, and related franchise analysis tools.</p>

        <h2>Educational Purpose</h2>
        <p>All content, analysis, and reports generated by our tools are for educational and informational purposes only. Nothing on this website or in our products constitutes legal advice, financial advice, or a recommendation to invest or not invest in any franchise opportunity.</p>
        <p>We strongly recommend consulting a qualified franchise attorney and financial advisor before making any franchise investment decision. Our tools are designed to complement — not replace — professional advice.</p>

        <h2>AI FDD Analyzer — Product Terms</h2>
        <p>Each purchase of the AI FDD Analyzer provides one (1) analysis of one (1) Franchise Disclosure Document. The analysis is generated by AI technology and is delivered as an on-screen results dashboard and downloadable PDF report.</p>
        <p>Each purchase generates a unique, single-use access link. Once an analysis has been completed, the access link cannot be reused for a new analysis. To analyze additional FDDs, a separate purchase is required.</p>
        <p>Analysis results are generated by AI and may not identify every risk or issue in your FDD. The quality and completeness of the analysis depends on the text provided. We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of the AI-generated analysis.</p>

        <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
        <p>Due to the digital nature of our products and the immediate delivery of AI-generated analysis, all sales are final. If you experience a technical issue that prevents your analysis from completing, contact us and we will work to resolve the issue or provide a replacement analysis.</p>

        <h2>Your Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>You are responsible for ensuring you have the right to share the FDD content you paste into our tool. Most FDDs are provided to prospective franchisees for their review and due diligence. You agree not to use our tools for any unlawful purpose.</p>

        <h2>Privacy of Your Data</h2>
        <p>FDD text you submit is processed for analysis purposes only and is not stored after your session. See our Privacy Policy for complete details on how we handle your information.</p>

        <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>The analysis methodology, risk detection patterns, and report format are proprietary to Franchise-Grade Systems. Your generated report is for your personal use. You may share it with your attorney, financial advisor, or business partners for due diligence purposes.</p>

        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>Franchise-Grade Systems provides tools and information to assist with franchise due diligence. We are not liable for investment decisions made based on our analysis. Franchise investments carry inherent risk, and past franchise failures do not guarantee future outcomes for any specific opportunity.</p>
        <p>Our total liability for any claim related to our services is limited to the amount you paid for the specific product at issue.</p>

        <h2>Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>Our services are provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not warrant that AI analysis will identify all risks in a franchise opportunity, that our tools will be error-free, or that results will be accurate in all cases.</p>

        <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to update these terms. Continued use of our services after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p>

        <h2>Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These terms are governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</p>
